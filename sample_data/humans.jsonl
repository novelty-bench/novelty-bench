They found a lightbulb, but the first lemur took it, and the other lemur kept searching thinking his friend wouldn't steal it and not share. Because the first lemur was trying to hide the lightbulb from his friend, he hid it in a secret spot but when he returned it was gone, teaching us that trusting your friends might help you in the long run. The other lemur learned not to underestimate others, and they stayed friends.", "On the river bank lived a lemur who discovered a light bulb still attached to a frayed wire.\n\"How beautiful!\" he exclaimed, reaching for the exposed copper strands.\nCuriously, he touched the exposed wire, and felt a violent zap through his body, as the light briefly illuminated.\n\nMoral: be careful of unknown technology.", "There once was a lemur who lived at a zoo. Every night a light would shine into her enclosure, which annoyed her to no end. One day the lemur watched as a maintenance crew changed the light bulb. That night, she climbed up the fence, stuck her little paws through the bars, and unscrewed the light bulb. Anytime the crew returned to change the lightbulb, the lemur would just unscrew it again later that night. Eventually the crew installed an entirely new light post at a different angle that did not shine into the lemur's enclosure at night and the lemur was happy. The moral of the story is: Persist and eventually things will work out for you.", "Once, there was a curious lemur. A kind human would lean open her shutters each morning to feed him snacks. Always, by the time the lemur had finished enjoying him meal, the shutters were closed again. If only he could get past those shutters, he could have food all day nonstop, rather than just in the mornings! The lemur decided to be clever; the next morning, rather than go for the snacks, he would make a run for it and try to get through the window. The sun had barely begun to poke out of the horizon when the lady went to open the shutters, bearing a tasty bowl of nuts. The lemur used all his self-restraint to ignore the nuts, instead leaping from the window ledge, through the gap, grabbing onto the woman's hair, and then leaping again to grasp the chandelier hanging from the ceiling in the center of the room. To the lemur, the chandelier looks liked an upside tree, covered in little fruits, each glowing as brilliantly as the sun. Those fruits were what the lady must be what the lady was hiding from him, he thought. She gave him peanuts while she kept the best and tastiest glowing berries for herself. Still holding on by one arm and his tail, he swung up to grabbed one of the little berries between his teeth. It tasted like ash and cobwebs, and it went crunch when he bit down. Wait---was it the berry that went crunch? No, it was his teeth! And maybe the berry too. The lemur passed out as he fell from the upside-down tree. In the months that followed, the woman nursed him back to health, but his broken mouth could never eat another nut---gruel was all he ever swallow again.\n\nMoral: be grateful for the gifts that are given to you.", "A company called lemur light bulb manufactured a big light bulb with a lemur in it, and the light bulb runs by people feeding the lemur and it runs on a power generator to light up the light bulb.
